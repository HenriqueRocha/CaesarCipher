# Caesar Cipher

The purpose of this project is to learn and teach Javascript by solving the problem of breaking a Caesar Cipher.
I love teaching in general and I still don't know Javascript.
Using this problem, I will teach algorithms and data structures that will allow us to solve this problem in an efficient way and I will learn Javascript along the way.
